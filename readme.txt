Adds a quick-access link to the Additional CSS panel in the Site Editor for block themes.

== Description ==

When WordPress introduced Full Site Editing (FSE) with block themes, the familiar "Additional CSS" option was moved from the Customizer to the Site Editor's Styles panel. This plugin brings back easy access by adding an "Additional CSS" link directly to the Appearance menu.

**Features:**

* Adds "Additional CSS" link under Appearance menu
* One-click access to the Site Editor CSS panel
* Only appears when using a block theme
* Lightweight and simple - no settings needed
* Works with any block theme

**How It Works:**

Simply activate the plugin and you'll see "Additional CSS" appear in your Appearance menu. Clicking it takes you directly to the CSS editing panel in the Site Editor.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `additional-css-shortcut` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to Appearance > Additional CSS to access the Site Editor CSS panel

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why don't I see the Additional CSS link? =

The link only appears when you're using a block theme (also known as an FSE theme). Classic themes still have access to Additional CSS through the Customizer.

= Does this plugin add any custom CSS functionality? =

No, this plugin simply provides a shortcut to the built-in Additional CSS feature in the Site Editor. It doesn't modify or extend the CSS functionality itself.

= Will this work with classic themes? =

No, this plugin is specifically designed for block themes. Classic themes already have easy access to Additional CSS through the Customizer (Appearance > Customize > Additional CSS).

= Does this plugin have any settings? =

No, this is an activate-and-forget plugin. Once activated, it simply adds the menu link.
